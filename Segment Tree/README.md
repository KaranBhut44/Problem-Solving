## 7. Help Ashu: (Hackerearth) | [Problem Link](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/advanced-data-structures/fenwick-binary-indexed-trees/practice-problems/algorithm/help-ashu-1/) 
**Problem Statement:** Given an array of N natural numbers, Solve the following queries:-
 - modify the element present at index i to x.
 - count the number of even numbers in range l to r inclusive.
 - count the number of odd numbers in range l to r inclusive.

## 8. Sereja and Brackets: (Codeforces) | [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/380/problem/C) 
**Problem Statement:** Sereja has a string s of length n, consisting of characters "(" and ")".Sereja needs to answer m queries, each of them is described by two integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n). The answer to the i-th query is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence sli, sli + 1, ..., sri. Help Sereja answer all queries.
 - **Note:**  bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are correct, ")(" and "(" are not.

## 9. Circular RMQ: (Codeforces) | [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/52/problem/C) 
**Problem Statement:** Given circular array a0, a1, ..., an - 1. There are two types of operations with it:
 - inc(lf, rg, v) — this operation increases each element on the segment [lf, rg] (inclusively) by v;
 - rmq(lf, rg) — this operation returns minimal value on the segment [lf, rg] (inclusively).

Assume segments to be circular, so if n = 5 and lf = 3, rg = 1, it means the index sequence: 3, 4, 0, 1.
